#Strokewise Kanji Finder

You can use it at [allantokuda.com/strokewise](http://www.allantokuda.com/strokewise).

##Overview

Strokewise allows you to rapidly look up kanji you see, to determine their
meanings and readings.  Its focus on general stroke direction provides an
alternative to the difficult classic process of looking up kanji in tables, by
stroke count, or by radicals.  Other tools allow you to draw the character
you're looking for, and are getting better, especially on mobile. But this tool
may still be helpful.

This tool is for kanji you encounter *in print*.  It is not necessary to look
up already digitized Kanji. The "Rikaichan" or "Rikaikun" browser extensions
will look up kanji for you instantly when you hover your mouse over them.  They go beyond this, in fact, to look up entire phrases for you.
